# Online Ledger (preview)

The Online Ledger is a web app I am working on designed to help you track expenses split between you and multiple other people (like your roommates for example). 

## Features (more coming soon!)

- Add, edit and delete members and watch the ledger dynamically reformat and recalculate (mobile optimization coming soon).
- Add cost name, amount and date infomation and see it split evenly among all members and tallied against payments and beginning balance for a current balance at the bottom of the screen. 
- Add "recurring" or "other" costs to be split.
- Add payments made by any member.

## Features Coming Soon

- login features to track your specific group of members
- month-to-month cost tracking
- auto-generated analytics graphics
- aesthetic makeover
- many more!
